## Introduction & Goal

Have you ever wondered what truly makes a country happy?

We'll be exploring the 2018-2019 World Happiness Report to uncover the key drivers of happiness, and to demonstrate that "softer" social factors can be just as, or even more, influential than economic prosperity.

### Research questions
- Which factors have the strongest link to happiness?
- How do strongest factors contribute to happiness?
- What separates the happiest countries?
- Does corruption undermine happiness?
- Can other factors make up for lower GDP?
